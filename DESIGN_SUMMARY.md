# Design Summary: Dr Adrian Laurence Website

## Inspiration Analysis & Adaptation

### Reference Sites Studied
- **Peter Attia MD** (https://peterattiamd.com/)
- **Dr. Rangan Chatterjee** (https://drchatterjee.com/)

### Information Architecture Adaptations

#### From Peter Attia MD:
- **Clean, professional layout** with strong typography hierarchy
- **Clear value proposition** prominently displayed above the fold
- **Structured content sections** with logical flow from problem to solution
- **Evidence-based positioning** with scientific credibility
- **Professional photography** and consistent visual branding

#### From Dr. Rangan Chatterjee:
- **Personal storytelling approach** with authentic voice
- **Practical, actionable content** focus
- **Strong call-to-action strategy** throughout the site
- **Educational content organization** with clear categorization
- **Community building elements** (newsletter, social proof)

### How We Differed Intentionally

#### Visual Design
- **Custom color palette**: Teal primary (#0D5C63) with gold accent (#E6B800) - completely different from both references
- **Typography**: Inter Tight + Inter combination vs. their serif choices
- **Layout**: More spacious, card-based design with rounded corners vs. their more linear approaches
- **Imagery**: Placeholder professional headshots vs. their lifestyle photography

#### Content Strategy
- **Evidence-based health optimization focus** vs. their broader approaches
- **Global audience** with international compliance requirements
- **Educational-only positioning** with explicit disclaimers
- **No embedded forms** - all CTAs link externally to Substack

#### Technical Implementation
- **Astro + TypeScript** vs. their likely WordPress/CMS setups
- **Static site generation** for performance
- **TailwindCSS** for consistent, maintainable styling
- **Content Collections** for structured content management

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Brand Positioning

### 2. User Experience Flow
1. **Hero**: Clear value prop + primary CTA (newsletter)
2. **Value Props**: Four key differentiators
