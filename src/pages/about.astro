          <p class="text-lg text-muted-600 mb-6">
            I'm a Family Medical and Lifestyle Medicine Doctor with over 17 years of experience. My journey into lifestyle medicine began when I noticed a pattern in my practice: people were struggling with the same health challenges, and traditional approaches weren't always enough.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-muted-600 mb-6">
            As a father myself, I understand the challenges of balancing health, family, and career. This personal experience, combined with my clinical expertise, drives my approach to helping people optimize their health without extremes.

        <h2 class="font-display font-semibold text-3xl mb-6">My Approach</h2>
        
        <h3 class="font-display font-semibold text-2xl mb-4">Evidence-Based, Not Dogmatic</h3>
        <p>
          I believe tactics are tools, not dogma. Every recommendation I make is grounded in peer-reviewed research and internationally recognized health guidelines. But I also recognize that what works in a research study might not work in your real life.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="font-display font-semibold text-2xl mb-4">Education-Focused</h3>
        <p>
          This website provides educational content only. I'm not providing personalized medical advice online, and this content is not a substitute for your own clinician. My goal is to help you understand the science so you can make informed decisions about your health.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="font-display font-semibold text-2xl mb-4">Practical Implementation</h3>
        <p>
          I focus on strategies that work within the constraints of busy schedules, family commitments, and modern life. No extreme diets, no unsustainable practices, no one-size-fits-all solutions.
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="font-display font-semibold text-2xl mb-4">Health Optimization Focus</h3>
        <p>
          My focus is on helping people optimize energy, strength, sleep, and longevity. This isn't about vanity metricsâ€”it's about building a foundation for a long, healthy, active life.
